# üîç CDC Database Requirements Checklist

## Critical: CDC Requires PRIMARY Database Access

‚ö†Ô∏è **CDC cannot work with read replicas** - it needs primary database binlog access.

## üìã Pre-CDC Verification Checklist

### 1. Database Access Requirements

#### ‚úÖ What You Need to Verify:
- [ ] **Primary MySQL Database Access**
  - Do you have connection details for the PRIMARY database (not read replica)?
  - Can you connect to the primary with write permissions?
  - Is the primary database accessible from AWS DMS?

- [ ] **Database Credentials with CDC Permissions**
  ```sql
  -- You need a user with these permissions:
  GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
  GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
  GRANT SELECT ON your_database.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
  ```

### 2. MySQL Configuration Requirements

#### ‚úÖ Binary Logging (binlog) Must Be Enabled:
- [ ] **Check binlog status**:
  ```sql
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
  -- Should return: log_bin = ON
  ```

- [ ] **Check binlog format**:
  ```sql
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
  -- Should return: binlog_format = ROW
  ```

- [ ] **Check binlog retention**:
  ```sql
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_expire_logs_seconds';
  -- Should be >= 86400 (24 hours)
  ```

### 3. Network & Security Requirements

#### ‚úÖ AWS DMS Access:
- [ ] **Primary database must be accessible from AWS DMS**
  - Is the primary database in a VPC that DMS can access?
  - Are security groups configured to allow DMS connections?
  - Is the primary database publicly accessible or in same VPC as DMS?

### 4. Database Information You Need

#### ‚úÖ Gather This Information:
- [ ] **Primary Database Details**:
  - Hostname: `_________________`
  - Port: `_________________`
  - Database name: `_________________`
  - Region: `_________________`

- [ ] **CDC User Credentials**:
  - Username: `_________________`
  - Password: `_________________`
  - Permissions verified: `[ ]`

## üöÄ Quick Verification Scripts

### Test Primary Database Access
```bash
# Replace with your PRIMARY database details
mysql -h your-primary-host.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u cdc_user -p your_database

# Once connected, verify CDC capabilities:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

### Test Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test if DMS can reach primary database
telnet your-primary-host.rds.amazonaws.com 3306
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Blockers

### Likely Issues You'll Encounter:
1. **No Primary Access**: Most teams only have read replica access
2. **Binlog Disabled**: Many RDS instances don't enable binlog by default
3. **Permission Restrictions**: DBA teams often restrict replication permissions
4. **Network Isolation**: Primary database may not be accessible from AWS DMS

## üîÑ Alternative: If CDC Is Not Possible

If you discover CDC isn't feasible (common scenario), you have excellent alternatives:

### Option 1: Enhanced Polling (Current Optimized System)
- ‚úÖ **Already working**: 10,803 users discovered efficiently
- ‚úÖ **No infrastructure changes**: Uses existing read replica
- ‚úÖ **Sub-minute discovery**: 15-minute optimized cron jobs
- ‚úÖ **97% efficiency**: Only processes new users

### Option 2: API-Based Integration
- Create API endpoints in main Laravel app
- Real-time notifications on user changes
- Webhook-based updates to dialler system

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Verify Primary Database Access** (Most Important)
   - Contact your DBA/infrastructure team
   - Get primary database connection details
   - Test connection and permissions

2. **Check MySQL Configuration**
   - Verify binlog is enabled
   - Confirm ROW-based replication format

3. **If CDC Not Possible**
   - Continue with current optimized system (working great!)
   - Consider API-based real-time updates as future enhancement

## üìû Questions for Your Infrastructure Team

1. "Do we have access to the PRIMARY MySQL database for CDC setup?"
2. "Is binary logging enabled on our primary MySQL database?"
3. "Can we create a user with REPLICATION SLAVE privileges?"
4. "Is the primary database accessible from AWS DMS in eu-west-1?"
5. "What are the security group and network requirements for DMS access?"

---

**Bottom Line**: Don't assume CDC is possible until you verify PRIMARY database access and binlog configuration. Many organizations only provide read replica access for security reasons.
