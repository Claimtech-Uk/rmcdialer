# ✅ Enhanced Queue Generation - Complete!

## 🎯 **Your Requirements - Fully Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Ordering Logic** ✅
**Before**: `currentScore ASC, createdAt ASC` (oldest first for tied scores)  
**After**: `currentScore ASC, createdAt DESC` (newest first for tied scores)

**Business Logic**: When multiple users have the same priority score, the **most recent** users get priority (fresher leads are better).

### **2. Two-Hour Cooling Period** ✅  
**Rule**: Users cannot be queued until 2+ hours after their `user_call_scores` record was created  
**Implementation**: Added filter `createdAt <= NOW() - 2 hours`

**Business Logic**: Prevents calling users immediately after they're added to the system - gives a "settling period".

### **3. Dynamic Queue Regeneration** ✅
**Before**: Fixed hourly schedule only  
**After**: Also triggers when either queue drops below 20 users  
**Safeguards**: Minimum 15-minute interval between auto-regenerations

**Business Logic**: Ensures agents always have adequate users to call, prevents queue starvation.

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Enhanced Queue Selection Process**:
```sql
-- New query logic for both queues
SELECT * FROM user_call_scores 
WHERE currentQueueType = 'unsigned_users'  -- or 'outstanding_requests'
  AND isActive = true
  AND nextCallAfter <= NOW()
  AND createdAt <= NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'  -- NEW: 2-hour cooling period
ORDER BY 
  currentScore ASC,     -- Lowest score first (0 = highest priority)
  createdAt DESC        -- NEW: Newest first for tied scores (fresher leads)
LIMIT 100;
```

### **Dynamic Regeneration Logic**:
```typescript
// Automatic monitoring every 5-10 minutes
if (unsignedQueue.length < 20 || outstandingQueue.length < 20) {
  if (timeSinceLastRegeneration >= 15_minutes) {
    triggerQueueRegeneration();
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **New Services & Endpoints**

### **QueueLevelMonitorService** ✅
- **Purpose**: Monitors queue levels and triggers auto-regeneration
- **Configuration**: 
  - `lowThreshold: 20` (regenerate when < 20 users)
  - `minRegenerationInterval: 15` minutes
  - `enableAutoRegeneration: true`

### **New API Endpoint** ✅
- **GET** `/api/cron/queue-level-check` - Monitor and auto-regenerate
- **POST** `/api/cron/queue-level-check` - Configuration and health checks

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Better Lead Quality** 🎯
- **Fresher Leads**: Newest users prioritized for tied scores
- **Proper Timing**: 2-hour cooling period prevents rushed calling
- **Consistent Availability**: Dynamic regeneration prevents queue starvation

### **Example Scenario**:
```
100 users with score 0 (new leads):
Before: User created Jan 1st called before user created Jan 5th
After:  User created Jan 5th called before user created Jan 1st (fresher!)

AND both users must be 2+ hours old before they can be queued.
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration & Monitoring**

### **Queue Level Monitoring** (Every 5-10 minutes):
```bash
# Check queue levels and auto-regenerate if needed
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/queue-level-check

# Response when regeneration triggered:
{
  "regenerationTriggered": true,
  "reason": "Unsigned queue low (15 < 20)",
  "queueLevels": {"unsigned": 15, "outstanding": 45},
  "thresholds": {"unsigned": 20, "outstanding": 20}
}
```

### **Configuration Updates**:
```bash
# Update thresholds and intervals
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/queue-level-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "updateConfig",
    "config": {
      "lowThreshold": 25,
      "minRegenerationInterval": 10,
      "enableAutoRegeneration": true
    }
  }'
```

## 🎯 **Business Impact**

### **Lead Quality Improvements**:
1. **Fresher Leads First**: Recent users prioritized for same-score groups
2. **Proper Lead Maturation**: 2-hour delay ensures leads are "ready"
3. **No Queue Starvation**: Agents always have users to call

### **Operational Benefits**:
1. **Automatic Management**: System self-manages queue levels
2. **Configurable Thresholds**: Easy to adjust based on call volume
3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into queue health

## 📋 **Deployment Steps**

```bash
# 1. Deploy enhanced services (already complete)
npm run build  # ✅ All services compile successfully

# 2. Set up queue level monitoring (every 5-10 minutes)
# Add to your cron scheduler:
# */5 * * * * curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/queue-level-check

# 3. Keep existing hourly population (backup/full refresh)
# Keep existing: GET /api/cron/populate-separated-queues (every hour)

# 4. Monitor and adjust thresholds as needed
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/queue-level-check \
  -d '{"action": "healthCheck"}'
```
