# üéØ Lead Scoring System - Business Overview

## üìã **What We're Building**

A smart priority system that ensures agents always call the **freshest, most responsive leads first**. Think of it like a **"hotness meter"** for leads - the hotter the lead, the sooner they get called.

### **The Simple Concept**
- **Every lead gets a score from 0 to 200**
- **Score 0 = Call them NOW** (hottest leads)
- **Score 200 = Stop calling** (give up threshold)
- **Lower scores always get called first**

---

## üèÜ **Core Principles**

### **1. Fresh Starts for New Situations**
When someone's situation changes (like signing a document), they get a **fresh score of 0** - treating them like a brand new lead again.

### **2. Leads Get Stale Over Time**
Every day a lead sits in our system, their score goes up by 5 points. Think of it like food going bad - the longer it sits, the less fresh it becomes.

### **3. Callbacks Always Come First**
If someone specifically asked us to call them back, we honor that regardless of their score.

### **4. No One Gets Lost**
We have safety nets to make sure leads don't accidentally disappear from our system.

---

## üîÑ **How It Works Day-to-Day**

### **Every Hour: Fresh Lead Discovery**
- **System scans** for new people who need calls
- **New leads get score 0** (highest priority)
- **Existing leads age up** (+5 points if it's been a day)
- **Really stale leads get removed** (score 200+)

### **Agent Experience**
```
Agent opens their queue and sees:
1. John Smith (Score 0) - New lead, needs signature
2. Mary Jones (Score 5) - 1 day old, no answer yesterday
3. Bob Wilson (Score 15) - 3 days old, was busy last time
4. Sarah Davis (Score 45) - 1 week old, multiple attempts
```

### **After Each Call**
- **Agent logs what happened** (answered, no answer, callback requested, etc.)
- **Lead's score adjusts** based on the outcome
- **Queue automatically reorders** for next call

---

## üìä **How Scores Change**

### **Good Outcomes (Score Goes Down = Higher Priority)**
- **"They want a callback"** ‚Üí Score -10 points (they're interested!)
- **"Answered but busy"** ‚Üí Score +2 points (minor bump)
- **"Making progress"** ‚Üí Score -5 points (promising!)

### **Bad Outcomes (Score Goes Up = Lower Priority)**
- **"No answer"** ‚Üí Score +10 points (harder to reach)
- **"Wrong number"** ‚Üí Score +50 points (big problem)
- **"Not interested"** ‚Üí Score +100 points (very low priority)

### **Daily Aging**
- **Monday through Saturday** ‚Üí +5 points per day
- **Sunday** ‚Üí No change (we don't age leads on Sundays)

---

## üéØ **Queue Types & Priorities**

### **1. Callbacks (Always First)**
- People who specifically asked to be called back
- We honor their requested time regardless of score
- These always appear at the top of the queue

### **2. Unsigned Users (Critical Priority)**
- People missing signatures (blocks everything else)
- Usually the most urgent queue
- Fresh leads start at score 0

### **3. Outstanding Requests (Important Priority)**
- People who signed but need to provide documents
- Still important but not as critical as signatures
- Fresh leads start at score 0

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Measures**

### **Problem: What if someone gets "lost"?**
**Solution:** We never actually delete anyone from our system. Instead, we mark them as "inactive" when they don't need calls, and "active" when they do. This way, if they need calls again later, we can easily find them.

### **Problem: What if our data is out of date?**
**Solution:** Before every call, we double-check that the person still needs to be called. If they've already completed everything, we don't bother them.

### **Problem: What if the system crashes?**
**Solution:** We keep detailed logs of everything and have recovery procedures to get back on track quickly.

## üìà **What Success Looks Like**

### **For Agents**
- ‚úÖ Always working the hottest leads first
- ‚úÖ Less time wasted on difficult/stale leads
- ‚úÖ Better conversion rates
- ‚úÖ Clear priority guidance

### **For Customers**
- ‚úÖ Faster response when they have new requirements
- ‚úÖ No annoying calls about things they've already completed
- ‚úÖ Callbacks happen when they requested
- ‚úÖ Professional, organized experience

### **For Business**
- ‚úÖ Higher conversion rates from better prioritization
- ‚úÖ More efficient use of agent time
- ‚úÖ Better customer satisfaction
- ‚úÖ Competitive advantage through responsiveness

## üöÄ **Implementation Plan**

### **Week 1-2: Set Up the Foundation**
- Update our database to track scores
- Build the scoring logic
- Test everything thoroughly

### **Week 3-4: Connect to Agent Interface**
- Show scores in the agent queue
- Add outcome selection when agents finish calls
- Train agents on the new system

### **Week 5-6: Monitor & Optimize**
- Watch how it performs in real use
- Adjust scoring rules if needed
- Add reporting and analytics

---

## üéÆ **Agent Training Points**

### **What Agents Need to Know**
1. **Always call the lowest score first** (except callbacks)
2. **Log every call outcome** (this updates the scoring)
3. **Callbacks override everything** (honor scheduled times)
4. **Fresh leads (score 0-10) are your priority** (highest success rates)

### **What Agents Will See**
- **Color-coded scores** (red = hot, blue = cold)
- **Clear reason why** each person is in the queue
- **Simple outcome buttons** after each call
- **Automatic queue reordering** (no manual sorting needed)

---

## üìä **Measuring Success**

### **Key Metrics We'll Track**
- **Average score when leads get called** (lower = better)
- **Percentage of calls to fresh leads** (score 0-20)
- **Agent calls per hour** (should improve)
- **Customer complaints about wrong calls** (should decrease)
- **Conversion rates by score range** (validates our scoring)

### **Monthly Reviews**
- **Are fresh leads converting better?** (they should)
- **Are agents more efficient?** (fewer wasted calls)
- **Are customers happier?** (fewer complaints)
- **Do we need to adjust scoring rules?** (based on results)

---

## ü§î **Future Enhancements**

Once the basic system is working well, we could add:

### **Smart Scheduling**
- **Best time to call** based on when people usually answer
- **Regional preferences** (different areas, different habits)
- **Time zone awareness** for better contact rates

### **Advanced Scoring**
- **Claim value consideration** (higher value = higher priority)
- **Bank type priority** (some banks more important than others)
- **Agent specialization matching** (match agents to their strengths)

### **Predictive Analytics**
- **Success probability scoring** (how likely is this lead to convert?)
- **Optimal contact timing** (when is this person most likely to answer?)
- **Resource allocation** (how many agents do we need when?)

---

## üí° **The Bottom Line**

This system ensures we **strike while the iron is hot** - contacting people when they're most likely to be responsive and engaged. By prioritizing fresh, responsive leads and letting stale ones age out naturally, we maximize our agents' time and improve the customer experience.

**Simple Rule:** Fresh leads get called first, callbacks get honored, and everyone wins.

**Next Step:** Begin Week 1 implementation with database setup and core scoring logic.
