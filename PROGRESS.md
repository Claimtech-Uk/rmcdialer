# 📊 RMC Dialler - Next.js 14 + tRPC Migration Progress

> **Reference**: [buildplan.md](./buildplan.md) - Detailed Next.js 14 + tRPC Migration Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview
Migrating from separate Express API + React frontend to a unified Next.js 14 application with tRPC for type-safe APIs. The system enables agents to efficiently contact users about financial claims with intelligent queue management, Twilio integration, and supervisor analytics.

## 🚀 **Current Migration Focus**

**🎯 NEXT STEPS**: Begin Migration Phase 1 - Architecture Foundation

1. **Create Next.js Structure**: Set up new app with App Router and proper directory structure
2. **tRPC Configuration**: Implement type-safe API layer with client and server setup
3. **Authentication Migration**: Convert Express auth to Next.js middleware and tRPC procedures
4. **Database Integration**: Move Prisma schema and set up database services

**📝 Implementation Priority**:
- Next.js 14 app creation and basic structure
- tRPC router and client configuration with React Query
- Authentication system with JWT and Next.js middleware
- Database layer with Prisma integration

---

## 🎉 **Architecture Migration Benefits**

### **From Current State**:
- Separate Express API server (Node.js + TypeScript)
- Separate React frontend (Vite + TypeScript)
- Manual API client with fetch
- Zustand for state management
- Two separate deployments

### **To Target State**:
- **Unified Next.js 14 Application** with App Router
- **Type-Safe tRPC APIs** with automatic TypeScript inference
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Built-in Optimizations** (caching, bundling, image optimization)
- **Single Vercel Deployment** with serverless functions

### **Key Improvements**:
1. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with tRPC procedure definitions
2. **Performance**: Better caching, code splitting, and optimization
3. **Developer Experience**: Automatic API client generation and IntelliSense
4. **Deployment**: Single app deployment instead of coordinating two services
5. **Maintenance**: One codebase, one deployment, unified monitoring
