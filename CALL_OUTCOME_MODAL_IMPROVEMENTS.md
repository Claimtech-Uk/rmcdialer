# Call Outcome Modal Improvements

## Summary
Fixed responsive design issues and added callback requirements for "might complete" and "going to complete" outcomes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Responsive Modal Design ✅
**Problem**: Modal was too small on desktop (fixed at max-w-md)
**Solution**: Made modal properly responsive with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: `max-w-md` (448px)
- **Small**: `sm:max-w-lg` (512px) 
- **Medium**: `md:max-w-2xl` (672px)
- **Large**: `lg:max-w-3xl` (768px)
- **XL**: `xl:max-w-4xl` (896px)

### 2. Callback Requirements ✅
**Added mandatory callbacks for**:
- `might_complete` - Customer showed interest
- `going_to_complete` - Customer committed to complete
- `call_back` - Customer requested callback (existing)

**Features**:
- Auto-sets default callback time to tomorrow 10 AM
- Submit button disabled without callback date/time
- Custom messages for each outcome type

### 3. Responsive Grid Layout ✅
**Outcome buttons now adapt to screen size**:
- **Mobile**: 1 column (stacked)
- **Tablet**: 2 columns (sm:grid-cols-2)
- **Desktop**: 3 columns (lg:grid-cols-3)

### 4. Enhanced UI Messages ✅
**Dynamic callback messages based on outcome**:
- **might_complete**: "The customer showed interest but needs more time. They will be called back to help them complete their claim."
- **going_to_complete**: "The customer committed to completing their claim. A follow-up call will ensure they complete the process."
- **call_back**: "The customer will appear in the callback queue at the scheduled time for the preferred agent to call back."

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `modules/calls/components/CallOutcomeModal.tsx`

### Key Code Changes
```typescript
// Callback required outcomes
const callbackRequiredOutcomes = ['call_back', 'might_complete', 'going_to_complete'];

// Responsive modal width
<Card className="w-full max-w-md sm:max-w-lg md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-3xl xl:max-w-4xl ...">

// Responsive grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-3">
```

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Better desktop experience** - Modal uses available screen space efficiently
2. **Enforced follow-ups** - Ensures customers who show interest get callbacks
3. **Clearer messaging** - Agents understand exactly what will happen for each outcome
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Works well on all screen sizes

## Testing
✅ Build successful
✅ All callback validations working
✅ Responsive design tested at all breakpoints
