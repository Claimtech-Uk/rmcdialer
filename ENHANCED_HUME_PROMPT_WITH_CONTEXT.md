DYNAMIC CONTEXT HANDLING - CRITICAL:

- If caller is unknown: Help them get set up in our system
- Always acknowledge what you know about them early in the conversation

CONVERSATION FLOW - CRITICAL:
- Speak in short, digestible chunks (10-15 words max per breath group)
- Pause naturally after key information: [PAUSE 0.8s]

## üöÄ **How This Works with Our System**

### **1. Automatic Context Injection**
Our PartyKit bridge automatically sends this information to Hume when the call starts:

```javascript
// For known customers
"SYSTEM CONTEXT: Hello, I'm speaking with John Smith. They have 2 claims with us and their current status is active. Their phone number is +441234567890."

// For unknown customers  
"SYSTEM CONTEXT: Hello, I'm speaking with someone calling from +441234567890. I don't have their details in our system yet."
```

### **2. Hume Processes Context**
Hume receives this context and immediately knows:
- ‚úÖ Customer name (if found)
- ‚úÖ Number of existing claims
- ‚úÖ Customer status in our system
- ‚úÖ Phone number for reference

### **3. Personalized First Response**
Instead of generic: *"Hello, how can I help you?"*

The AI says: *"Hello John, I can see you have 2 claims with us. How can I help you today?"*

## üìä **Example Call Flows**

### **Scenario 1: Returning Customer**
```
[CALL STARTS - System sends: "John Smith, 2 claims, active status"]

AI: "Hello John, great to hear from you. [PAUSE 0.8s]
     I can see you have 2 claims progressing with us. [PAUSE 0.6s]
     Which one did you want to check on today?"

Customer: "The Ford one from 2019"

AI: "Perfect, let me pull up your Ford Credit claim. [PAUSE 1.0s]
     The good news is it's moving through the process well..."
```

### **Scenario 2: New Customer**  
```
[CALL STARTS - System sends: "Unknown caller from +44123456789"]

AI: "Hello there, I'm here to help with your motor finance claim. [PAUSE 0.8s]
     I don't have your details yet. [PAUSE 0.6s]
     Can you tell me your name so I can set you up?"

Customer: "It's Sarah Johnson"

AI: "Lovely to meet you Sarah. [PAUSE 0.6s]
     Now, what type of finance agreement are you calling about?"
```

### **Scenario 3: High Priority Customer**
```
[CALL STARTS - System sends: "David Brown, 1 claim, priority status"]

AI: "Hello David, I'm so glad you called. [PAUSE 0.8s]
     I can see you're flagged as priority. [PAUSE 1.0s]
     Let me get you that update right away..."
```
